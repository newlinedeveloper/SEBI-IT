## 🧭 **Approach / Method**

### Step 1️⃣ — **Identify genders**

Use clues like:

* Brother → Male
* Sister → Female
* Husband / Father → Male
* Wife / Mother → Female

### Step 2️⃣ — **Break the statement**

Translate into small parts.

Example:

> A is the son of B.
> → B → Parent of A (B is A’s father or mother)

### Step 3️⃣ — **Build a family tree diagram**

Draw vertical for generations, horizontal for siblings, arrows for relationships.

### Step 4️⃣ — **Simplify indirect relations**

Like:

> Mother’s husband’s brother = Uncle
> Break step-by-step:

* Mother’s husband → Father
* Father’s brother → Uncle

## 💬 **4️⃣ Coded Relation Example**

Relations are represented by symbols:

```
P + Q → P is the father of Q  
P – Q → P is the sister of Q  
P × Q → P is the husband of Q  
P ÷ Q → P is the daughter of Q
```

(b) A is father-in-law of C
(c) A is brother of C
(d) A is uncle of C

**Solution:**
From right to left:
B × C → B is **husband** of C
A + B → A is **father** of B

→ A → father of B (who is husband of C)
So A is **father-in-law** of C.

✅ **Answer:** (b) Father-in-law of C.
