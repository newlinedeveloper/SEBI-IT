## 🧠 **Concept**

Ranking and Ordering questions test your ability to **compare, calculate, and position people or things** in a sequence — based on height, age, marks, position in a queue, etc.

You’ll usually be asked about:

* The **total number** of people/items.
* The **position/rank** of a person from the other end.
* The **middle position** or **between two persons**.
* The **comparison of ranks** between two persons.

---

## 🔹 **Basic Direction Reminder**

* **Top / Front / Left →** count from the beginning.
* **Bottom / Back / Right →** count from the end.

---

## 📘 **Common Formulas**

### 1️⃣ **Total number of persons**

If a person’s rank is given from both ends:
[
\text{Total} = \text{Rank from top} + \text{Rank from bottom} - 1
]

---

### 2️⃣ **Rank from opposite side**

If total persons = N, and person’s rank from one side = R:
[
\text{Rank from opposite side} = N - R + 1
]

---

### 3️⃣ **Number of persons between two people**

If A’s rank = R₁, B’s rank = R₂:
[
\text{Between} = |R₁ - R₂| - 1
]

---

### 4️⃣ **Middle Position (Odd number of persons)**

[
\text{Middle} = \frac{N + 1}{2}
]

---

### 5️⃣ **Persons on one side**

If total = N, rank of one person = R:

* Persons ahead of him = R - 1
* Persons behind him = N - R

## 🔹 **Types of Ranking Questions**

---

### 🧮 **Type 1: Total from both ends**

**Example 1:**
Ravi is 7th from the top and 8th from the bottom.
Find total students.

**Solution:**
Total = 7 + 8 − 1 = ✅ **14 students**

---

### 🧮 **Type 2: Rank from opposite end**

**Example 2:**
A is 10th from the left in a row of 25 students.
Find A’s rank from the right.

**Solution:**
Right = 25 − 10 + 1 = ✅ **16th from the right**

---

### 🧮 **Type 3: Persons between two ranks**

**Example 3:**
In a line of students, A is 6th from the left, and B is 10th from the left.
How many students are between A and B?

**Solution:**
Between = |10 − 6| − 1 = ✅ **3 students**

---

### 🧮 **Type 4: Total when two different sides given**

**Example 4:**
In a class, Ravi is 9th from the top and 11th from the bottom.
How many students are there in total?

**Solution:**
Total = 9 + 11 − 1 = ✅ **19 students**

---

### 🧮 **Type 5: Between from different sides**

**Example 5:**
In a row of boys, A is 12th from the left end and B is 17th from the right end.
If there are 30 boys in total, how many boys are between A and B?

**Solution:**
Convert both to same side.

B’s position from left = 30 − 17 + 1 = 14th from left
A = 12th from left
Between = |14 − 12| − 1 = 1

✅ **Answer:** 1 boy between A and B.

---

### 🧮 **Type 6: Finding Total when Two Positions Known**

**Example 6:**
In a class, Sita is 12th from the top and 18th from the bottom.
Find total students.

**Solution:**
Total = 12 + 18 − 1 = ✅ **29 students**

---

### 🧮 **Type 7: Finding Who is in Middle**

**Example 7:**
In a line of 15 students, who is at the middle position?

**Solution:**
Middle = (15 + 1)/2 = ✅ **8th position**

---

### 🧮 **Type 8: Finding Number of Students on One Side**

**Example 8:**
In a class of 20 students, Ramesh is 5th from the top.
How many students are below him?

**Solution:**
Below = 20 − 5 = ✅ **15 students**

---

### 🧮 **Type 9: Two People Exchanging Positions**

**Example 9:**
In a row of 40 students, A is 10th from the left and B is 12th from the right.
If they exchange their positions, A becomes 15th from the left.
Find B’s new position from the right.

**Step 1:** Total = 40
**Step 2:** A’s new = 15 from left → from right = 40 − 15 + 1 = 26
**Step 3:** Since A & B swapped, B’s new = A’s old = 10 from left → from right = 40 − 10 + 1 = ✅ **31st from right**

---

### 🧮 **Type 10: Ranks in Two Subjects**

**Example 10:**
In a class of 60 students, A ranks 12th in Science and 18th in Math.
What is the least number of students who scored better in both subjects?

**Concept:**
Minimum common = (12 + 18) − 60 = (30 − 60) = **0 (Not possible)**
So none scored better in both.
✅ **Answer:** 0

| Opposite side rank    | N − R + 1                 | 25 − 10 + 1 = 16     |     |   |      |      |
| Between two ranks     |                           | R₁ − R₂              | − 1 |   | 10−6 | −1=3 |
| Middle position       | (N + 1)/2                 | (15+1)/2=8           |     |   |      |      |
| Students ahead/behind | Ahead = R−1, Behind = N−R | N=20, R=5 → 15 below |     |   |      |      |

## 🧾 **Practice Set**

Try solving these:

1️⃣ Ramesh is 12th from the left and 9th from the right. How many students?
→ 12 + 9 − 1 = **20**

2️⃣ In a queue of 30 people, A is 5th from the front. Find his position from the back.
→ 30 − 5 + 1 = **26th**

3️⃣ In a row of 40, A is 10th from left, B is 25th from left. How many between them?
→ |25 − 10| − 1 = **14**

4️⃣ In a class, the total is 50. Rina is 20th from the top. How many below her?
→ 50 − 20 = **30**

5️⃣ In a row of 25, A is 8th from left, B is 10th from right. How many between them?
→ B = 25 − 10 + 1 = 16 → |16 − 8| − 1 = **7**

## 🧩 **Visual Tip**

If you struggle with left/right or top/bottom:

* Always **draw a horizontal or vertical line**.
* Mark positions step by step.
* Cross-check using formulas.
