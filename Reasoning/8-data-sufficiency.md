## 🧠 **Concept: What is Data Sufficiency?**

In **Data Sufficiency (DS)** questions, you’re *not* asked to find the **actual answer**, but to decide **whether the given information is sufficient** to answer the question.

So your focus should be on **logical sufficiency**, not calculation.

---

### ⚙️ **Question Format**

Each question has:

1️⃣ A **question statement** (what we need to find), and
2️⃣ **Two (or sometimes three) statements** with data.

You must determine whether the given data **alone or together** is *sufficient* to answer the question.

---

## 🪧 **Common Options (Standard Format)**

Usually, the options are standardized as:

| Option  | Meaning                                                                            |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **(1)** | Statement I alone is sufficient, but Statement II alone is not sufficient.         |
| **(2)** | Statement II alone is sufficient, but Statement I alone is not sufficient.         |
| **(3)** | Both statements I and II together are sufficient, but neither alone is sufficient. |
| **(4)** | Either statement I or II alone is sufficient.                                      |
| **(5)** | Even both statements together are not sufficient.                                  |

---

## 🧩 **Approach / Strategy**

1️⃣ **Understand what is asked.**
→ Identify the exact unknown: Age, rank, direction, etc.

2️⃣ **Analyze each statement separately.**
→ Can this statement alone answer the question *completely*?

3️⃣ **If not sufficient, combine both.**
→ Check if together they give enough info.

4️⃣ **Avoid assumptions.**
→ Only use what is clearly stated — no guessing.

---

## 🧠 **Example 1: (Age-based)**

**Question:**
What is A’s age?

**Statements:**
1️⃣ A is 5 years younger than B.
2️⃣ B is 10 years old.

**Analysis:**

* From (1) alone → we know A = B − 5 → but we don’t know B’s age → ❌ Not sufficient.
* From (2) alone → we know B’s age but not A’s relation → ❌ Not sufficient.
* Combining (1) + (2): A = 10 − 5 = 5 ✅ Sufficient.

✅ **Answer:** Both statements together are sufficient → **Option (3)**

---

## 🧩 **Example 2: (Ranking)**

**Question:**
What is Neha’s rank from the top in a class of 30 students?

**Statements:**
1️⃣ Neha is 10th from the bottom.
2️⃣ There are 19 students above Neha.

**Analysis:**

* From (1): Rank from top = 30 − 10 + 1 = 21 ✅ Sufficient
* From (2): If 19 above, Neha is 20th from top ✅ Sufficient

✅ **Answer:** Each statement alone is sufficient → **Option (4)**

---

## 🧩 **Example 3: (Direction Sense)**

**Question:**
In which direction is A from B?

**Statements:**
1️⃣ A is east of C, who is north of B.
2️⃣ A is north of D, and D is east of B.

**Analysis:**

* From (1): B → C (north), C → A (east). So A is **northeast** of B ✅ Sufficient.
* From (2): B → D (east), D → A (north). So A is **northeast** of B ✅ Sufficient.

✅ **Answer:** Either statement alone is sufficient → **Option (4)**

---

## 🧩 **Example 4: (Blood Relation)**

**Question:**
How is A related to B?

**Statements:**
1️⃣ B is the father of C.
2️⃣ A is the sister of C.

**Analysis:**

* (1) alone: tells us about B and C, not A → ❌
* (2) alone: tells us about A and C, not B → ❌
* (1) + (2): If B is father of C and A is sister of C → A is **daughter of B** ✅

✅ **Answer:** Both together are sufficient → **Option (3)**

---

## 🧩 **Example 5: (Coding-Decoding)**

**Question:**
How is the word “BAT” coded?

**Statements:**
1️⃣ “CAT” is coded as “312”.
2️⃣ “BALL” is coded as “2112”.

**Analysis:**

* (1): Only gives CAT → cannot decode BAT → ❌
* (2): BALL → partial overlap, but unclear → ❌
* Together: No consistent pattern visible → ❌

✅ **Answer:** Even both together are not sufficient → **Option (5)**

---

## 🧩 **Example 6: (Numbers/Equations)**

**Question:**
What is the value of x?

**Statements:**
1️⃣ 2x + 3 = 9
2️⃣ x² = 9

**Analysis:**

* (1): 2x + 3 = 9 → x = 3 ✅ Sufficient
* (2): x² = 9 → x = ±3 → two possible values → ❌ Not sufficient

✅ **Answer:** Statement 1 alone is sufficient → **Option (1)**

## 🧠 **Quick Shortcut Tips**

| Tip                                            | Explanation                                     |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| ✅ Treat each statement as *standalone* first   | Don’t mix data until needed                     |
| 🚫 Avoid assumptions                           | Use only the given info                         |
| 🧭 Use diagrams for direction/family questions | Visuals clarify sufficiency                     |
| ⏳ Practice time control                        | Spend ~40–50 sec per question                   |
| 💡 Focus on *logic, not math*                  | You’re judging sufficiency, not computing value |
