Perfect 👌 Let’s now cover **Topic 11️⃣: Critical Reasoning** — one of the most **conceptual and judgment-based** reasoning areas found in high-level aptitude and banking/management exams.

---

## 🧠 Concept Overview

**Critical Reasoning** questions test your ability to:

* Understand arguments logically.
* Identify assumptions, inferences, and conclusions.
* Evaluate arguments (strengthen/weaken).
* Find cause-effect relations.

These are **verbal logic** questions — accuracy > speed.

---

## 🔹 1️⃣ Assumption Questions

### 🔸 Concept:

An **assumption** is something **unstated but necessary** for an argument to hold true.

> Think of it as the “invisible bridge” between the statement and conclusion.

---

### 🔸 Example 1:

**Statement:**
Online education helps students learn better.

**Assumptions:**

1. Students are using online education platforms.
2. Online education provides better resources than traditional methods.

✅ **Correct Answer:** (1) and (2) are implicit.
Because if online education helps students *learn better*, it assumes they *use it* and it’s *effective*.

---

### 🔸 Tip:

✔ Assume what *must be true* for the statement to make sense.
❌ Don’t assume things that may or may not be true.

---

## 🔹 2️⃣ Inference Questions

### 🔸 Concept:

An **inference** is a **logical conclusion** drawn from the given facts — **not directly stated**, but must **logically follow**.

---

### 🔸 Example 2:

**Statements:**
All engineers are intelligent.
Some intelligent people are hardworking.

**Possible Inferences:**

1. Some hardworking people are engineers. ❌ (Not necessarily true)
2. Some engineers may be hardworking. ✅ (Possible)

✅ **Correct Answer:** 2 — because it’s a *possible* logical outcome.

---

### 🔸 Tip:

* Use **Venn Diagrams** for clarity.
* Avoid **overgeneralization**.
* Choose only what **must logically follow**.

---

## 🔹 3️⃣ Strengthening / Weakening Arguments

### 🔸 Concept:

These questions test **evaluation skills** — you decide which statement **supports** (strengthens) or **contradicts** (weakens) an argument.

---

### 🔸 Example 3:

**Argument:**
Electric cars are better than petrol cars because they reduce pollution.

**Which of the following strengthens the argument?**
A. Electric cars are more expensive. ❌
B. Electric cars emit zero tailpipe gases. ✅
C. Petrol cars have higher mileage. ❌

✅ **Answer:** (B) — directly supports the claim about pollution reduction.

---

### 🔸 Example 4:

**Which weakens the argument?**
A. Electricity for cars comes from coal plants. ✅
(Because coal causes pollution → weakens “reduce pollution” claim)

---

### 🔸 Tip:

* To **strengthen**, find evidence that supports or justifies the claim.
* To **weaken**, find exceptions or contradictory facts.

---

## 🔹 4️⃣ Cause and Effect

### 🔸 Concept:

Identify whether one event **caused** the other, or if both are **effects** of a common cause.

---

### 🔸 Example 5:

**Statements:**

1. The government increased taxes on fuel.
2. Public transport usage has increased sharply.

**Explanation:**
Tax increase (cause) → higher fuel cost → more people use buses/trains (effect).

✅ **Answer:** Statement 1 is the **cause**, Statement 2 is the **effect**.

---

### 🔸 Example 6:

**Statements:**

1. Many people are falling ill after drinking water from a river.
2. The river water has been found contaminated.

✅ **Answer:** Statement 2 → **cause**, Statement 1 → **effect**

## 🔑 Practice Tips

* 🔹 Read each question twice — first for **meaning**, then for **logic**.
* 🔹 Avoid **emotional or extreme** options (“always”, “never”, etc.).
* 🔹 Learn to identify **premise → conclusion** flow.
* 🔹 Practice **short RC passages** from GMAT / Bank PO reasoning sections.
