## 🧠 **3️⃣ Syllogism — Concept Overview**

**Definition:**
Syllogism is a type of logical reasoning where conclusions are drawn from two or more given statements (called premises).
Your task is to determine whether the conclusions logically follow from the given statements.

## 🧩 **Basic Terms**

| Term                 | Meaning                     | Example                 |
| -------------------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| **All A are B**      | Every A is inside B         | All dogs are animals    |
| **Some A are B**     | At least one A is inside B  | Some cats are animals   |
| **No A is B**        | A and B have no overlap     | No pen is pencil        |
| **Some A are not B** | At least one A is outside B | Some cars are not bikes |

## 🖍 **Venn Diagram Approach (Best method for reasoning exams)**

Each statement is represented as a diagram showing relationships.

Let’s go case-by-case 👇

---

### **Case 1: All A are B**

📘 Example:
All Dogs are Animals.
🌀 Diagram:
A (Dogs) is completely inside B (Animals).

✅ Possible conclusions:

* Some Animals are Dogs → **True**
* All Dogs are Animals → **True**
* Some Dogs are Animals → **True**
  ❌ All Animals are Dogs → **False**

---

### **Case 2: Some A are B**

📘 Example:
Some Cats are Dogs.
🌀 Diagram:
A (Cats) and B (Dogs) partially overlap.

✅ Possible conclusions:

* Some Dogs are Cats → **True**
* Some Cats are Dogs → **True**
  ❌ All Cats are Dogs → **False**

---

### **Case 3: No A is B**

📘 Example:
No Apple is Orange.
🌀 Diagram:
A (Apple) and B (Orange) are completely separate.

✅ Possible conclusions:

* No Orange is Apple → **True**
  ❌ Some Apple are Orange → **False**

---

### **Case 4: Some A are not B**

📘 Example:
Some Students are not Teachers.
🌀 Diagram:
Some part of A lies outside B.

✅ Possible conclusions:

* Some Teachers are not Students → **Cannot be said (depends)**

## ⚙️ **Types of Syllogism Questions**

1. **Standard Type (2 statements + 2 conclusions)**
2. **Possibility Type ("can be", "may be")**
3. **“Only” or “Only a few” statements**
4. **Reverse Syllogism (Conclusion given → Find possible statements)**

## 💡 **Key Rules**

| Statement Type   | Conversion           | Inference       |
| ---------------- | -------------------- | --------------- |
| All A are B      | Some B are A (✅)     | All B are A (❌) |
| Some A are B     | Some B are A (✅)     | —               |
| No A is B        | No B is A (✅)        | —               |
| Some A are not B | Some B are not A (❌) | —               |

## 🧩 **Example 1:**

**Statements:**

1. All Dogs are Cats.
2. Some Cats are Lions.

**Conclusions:**
1️⃣ Some Lions are Dogs.
2️⃣ Some Cats are Dogs.

**Solution:**
Let’s draw a diagram →
Dogs ⊂ Cats, and Lions partially overlap with Cats.

✅ Conclusion 1: “Some Lions are Dogs” → ❌ No direct link between Dogs and Lions.
✅ Conclusion 2: “Some Cats are Dogs” → ✅ True (since all Dogs are Cats, some Cats are definitely Dogs).

**✔ Correct Answer:** Only conclusion 2 follows.

---

## 🧩 **Example 2: (Possibility Type)**

**Statements:**

1. All Books are Papers.
2. Some Papers are Pens.

**Conclusions:**
1️⃣ Some Pens are Books.
2️⃣ It is possible that some Pens are Books.

**Solution:**
From the diagram:
Books are inside Papers, Pens partially overlap with Papers.
We can’t confirm overlap between Pens & Books, but **it is possible**.

✅ Conclusion 1: ❌ False
✅ Conclusion 2: ✅ True (Possible case)

**✔ Correct Answer:** Only conclusion 2 follows.

---

## 🧩 **Example 3: (Negative Statement)**

**Statements:**

1. All Apples are Fruits.
2. No Fruit is Vegetable.

**Conclusions:**
1️⃣ No Apple is Vegetable.
2️⃣ Some Fruits are not Apples.

**Solution:**
From the diagram:

* Apple inside Fruits
* Fruits and Vegetables are separate

✅ Conclusion 1: ✅ True
✅ Conclusion 2: ✅ True (since all Fruits are not Apples)

**✔ Correct Answer:** Both follow.

---

## 🧩 **Example 4: “Only” Statements**

**Statement:**
Only Dogs are Pets.

Meaning → **All Pets are Dogs** (reverse of "Only" statement).
✅ So the statement “Only A are B” → means “All B are A”.

---

## 🧩 **Example 5: “Some Not” Statements**

**Statements:**

1. Some Cars are Bikes.
2. Some Bikes are not Scooters.

**Conclusions:**

* Some Cars are not Scooters → ❌ Can’t be said
* Some Bikes are Cars → ✅ True

---

## 🧠 **Pro Tips for Exam:**

1. **Use Venn Diagrams** – fastest and safest approach.
2. **Handle “Possibility” carefully** – If it can be true, mark it ✅.
3. **“Only” changes direction** – “Only A are B” → “All B are A”.
4. **No + All** → Always leads to a “No” conclusion.
5. Practice mixed question sets (5–10 per day).

Would you like me to create a **practice worksheet (10 questions)** on syllogism with explanations — like a mini test you can solve daily?
