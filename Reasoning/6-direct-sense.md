## 🧭 **Concept**

Direction Sense questions test your understanding of **movement, turning, and orientation**.

They typically involve:

* A person walking a certain distance in given directions.
* You must find:

  * Final direction they’re facing, or
  * Distance/direction from the starting point.

---

## 🧩 **Basic Directions**

Always visualize or sketch a simple coordinate compass:

```
          North (↑)
             |
West (←) ————+————→ East
             |
          South (↓)
```

### 🔸 Inter-cardinal directions:

* North-East (NE)
* North-West (NW)
* South-East (SE)
* South-West (SW)

---

## 📘 **Golden Rules**

1. **Turn Logic**

   * Turn **right** → rotate 90° clockwise
   * Turn **left** → rotate 90° anticlockwise

2. **Facing Rule**

   * If facing North → Right = East, Left = West
   * If facing East → Right = South, Left = North
   * If facing South → Right = West, Left = East
   * If facing West → Right = North, Left = South

3. **Distance Calculation**

   * Use **Pythagoras theorem** when needed:
     ( \text{Distance} = \sqrt{(x^2 + y^2)} )

---

## 🧮 **Type 1: Final Direction**

### **Example 1**

A person starts facing **North**, turns **right**, then **left**, then **right** again. Which direction is he facing?

**Solution:**

* Start North
* Turn Right → East
* Turn Left → North
* Turn Right → East

✅ **Answer:** East

---

## 🧮 **Type 2: Distance & Final Position**

### **Example 2**

A walks 5 km north, then 3 km east. Find his distance and direction from the starting point.

**Solution:**
Visualize or draw a coordinate:

```
Start → (0,0)
5 km North → (0,5)
3 km East → (3,5)
```

Use Pythagoras:
[
Distance = \sqrt{(3^2 + 5^2)} = \sqrt{34} ≈ 5.83 km
]

✅ **Answer:** 5.83 km, **North-East** of starting point.

---

## 🧮 **Type 3: Complex Movement**

### **Example 3**

Ravi walks 4 km north, turns right and walks 3 km, turns right and walks 2 km, turns left and walks 1 km.
Find Ravi’s final position and direction from the starting point.

**Step-by-step:**

* 4 km North → (0,4)
* Turn Right → East → +3 → (3,4)
* Turn Right → South → -2 → (3,2)
* Turn Left → East → +1 → (4,2)

So Ravi ends at (4,2).

From start (0,0) → displacement = √(4² + 2²) = √20 = 4.47 km
Direction → East + North = **North-East**

✅ **Answer:** 4.47 km, North-East.

---

## 🧮 **Type 4: Final Facing Direction**

### **Example 4**

A man is facing East. He turns left, walks 5 m, turns left again, walks 10 m, then turns right and walks 5 m. Which direction is he facing now?

**Solution:**
1️⃣ Facing East
2️⃣ Turn Left → North
3️⃣ Walk 5 m
4️⃣ Turn Left → West
5️⃣ Walk 10 m
6️⃣ Turn Right → North
7️⃣ Walk 5 m

✅ **Final Facing:** North

---

## 🧮 **Type 5: Return to Starting Point**

### **Example 5**

A man walks 6 km north, 8 km east, 6 km south, and 8 km west.
How far is he from the starting point?

**Solution:**
He moves in a perfect rectangle — north & south cancel (6–6=0), east & west cancel (8–8=0).

✅ **Answer:** 0 km (Back to starting point)

---

## 🧮 **Type 6: Shortest Path / Displacement**

### **Example 6**

A person walks 10 km north, 4 km west, and 3 km south.
Find shortest distance and direction from starting point.

**Solution:**
Plot movements:

* North: +10
* South: −3
  → Net North = 7 km
* West = 4 km

[
Distance = \sqrt{(7^2 + 4^2)} = \sqrt{65} ≈ 8.06 km
]

Direction: **North-West**

✅ **Answer:** 8.06 km, North-West.

---

## 🧮 **Type 7: Direction Between Two Persons**

### **Example 7**

A and B start from the same point.
A walks 5 km north, B walks 5 km east.
In which direction is A with respect to B?

**Solution:**
From B’s position, A is **North-West**.

✅ **Answer:** North-West.

---

## 🧮 **Type 8: Multiple Turns**

### **Example 8**

Ravi starts facing South, walks 4 m, turns right, walks 3 m, turns right again, walks 2 m. Which direction is he facing now?

**Solution:**

* Facing South → Right = West
* Walk 3 → facing West
* Turn Right again → facing North

✅ **Answer:** North.

## 🧾 **Practice Examples**

Try solving mentally:

1️⃣ A walks 4 km east, then 3 km north. Find distance & direction.
→ √(4²+3²)=5 km, North-East.
Would you like me to create a **Direction Sense Daily Practice Sheet (10 Questions with diagram-based explanations)** next — from basic to tricky, like exam-style reasoning sets?

2️⃣ A faces west, turns left, walks 4 m, then turns right and walks 3 m. Which way is he facing?
→ Facing South.

3️⃣ A walks 5 m north, 6 m east, 2 m south. How far is he from start?
→ Net north = 3, east = 6 → √(3²+6²)=6.7 m → North-East.
