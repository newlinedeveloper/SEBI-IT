## 🧠 REASONING SYLLABUS BREAKDOWN

### 1️⃣ **Puzzles and Seating Arrangement (8–10 Questions)**

This is the most scoring yet time-consuming section — practice is key.

#### 🔹 **Types:**

* **Box Puzzle:** People/items arranged in boxes labeled A–H, find who/what is in which box.
* **Designation-based:** Assign job roles, companies, or ranks based on clues.
* **Floor & Flat-based Puzzle:** People live on different floors/flats in a building.
* **Month & Date-based Puzzle:** People attend events on different dates/months.
* **Single Row & Double Row Arrangement:** Arrange people facing same or opposite directions.
* **Circular Arrangement:** Arrange people around a circle facing inwards/outwards.

#### 🔹 **Tips:**

* Draw clear tables or diagrams.
* Note direct information first, then link indirect clues.
* Use elimination (cross-check impossible positions).
* Practice 2–3 puzzles daily.

---

### 2️⃣ **Inequality (4–5 Questions)**

Questions involve comparison between elements using symbols.

#### 🔹 **Symbols:**

> > , < , ≥ , ≤ , =

#### 🔹 **Example:**

If A > B = C < D, then what is the relation between A and D?

#### 🔹 **Approach:**

* Combine statements.
* Check direction of inequality.
* Practice symbol-based shortcuts (>, ≥ means “definitely greater” etc.)

---

### 3️⃣ **Syllogism (4–5 Questions)**

Logical reasoning based on statements and conclusions.

#### 🔹 **Example:**

Statements:

* All dogs are cats.
* Some cats are lions.
  Conclusions:
* Some lions are dogs. (❌)
* Some cats are dogs. (✅)

#### 🔹 **Approach:**

* Use **Venn Diagrams** for clarity.
* Understand **possibility vs definite** conclusions.
* Practice with **“only”**, **“some not”**, and **reverse syllogism** questions.

---

### 4️⃣ **Chinese Coding / Coding-Decoding (4–5 Questions)**

Find the logic or pattern behind coded messages.

#### 🔹 **Types:**

* **Letter coding:** A = 1, B = 2 type or letter shifting.
* **Number coding:** Assign numbers to words.
* **Substitution coding:** Words replaced by symbols or phrases.
* **Matrix coding:** Letters mapped using a grid.

#### 🔹 **Approach:**

* Compare words with similar patterns.
* Look for repetition (common words → same code).
* Decode step-by-step.

---

### 5️⃣ **Blood Relation (3–4 Questions)**

Identify relationships based on given statements.

#### 🔹 **Example:**

A is the brother of B. C is the sister of A. How is C related to B? → **Sister**

#### 🔹 **Approach:**

* Draw family tree diagrams.
* Note gender carefully.
* Learn indirect questions (e.g., “Mother’s husband’s brother” → uncle).

---

### 6️⃣ **Direction Sense (3–4 Questions)**

Questions about movement and orientation.

#### 🔹 **Example:**

A walks 5 km north, then 3 km east. Find the direction and distance from starting point.

#### 🔹 **Approach:**

* Use coordinate diagram.
* Memorize directions: North ↑, South ↓, East →, West ←
* Apply **Pythagoras theorem** for shortest distance.

---

### 7️⃣ **Ranking and Order**

Arrange people/things based on height, marks, position, etc.

#### 🔹 **Example:**

Ravi is 7th from the top and 8th from the bottom. How many students are there?
→ (7 + 8 – 1) = **14**

---

### 8️⃣ **Data Sufficiency**

You don’t solve the question; you decide if the given data is enough to solve it.

#### 🔹 **Example:**

What is the age of A?
(1) A is 5 years younger than B.
(2) B is 10 years old.
→ Both (1) and (2) are required.

---

### 9️⃣ **Machine Input-Output**

Sequence of words/numbers arranged according to logic.

#### 🔹 **Example:**

Input: 82, 34, 65 → Stepwise rearrangement in ascending order.

#### 🔹 **Approach:**

* Observe pattern (alphabetical or numerical).
* Identify logic of first two steps.

---

### 🔟 **Alphabetical / Series-Based**

Find missing letters, patterns, or next element.

#### 🔹 **Example:**

A, C, F, J, O, ?
→ Difference = +1, +2, +3, +4 → Next = +5 = **U**

---

### 1️⃣1️⃣ **Critical Reasoning**

Judgement-based reasoning — often part of advanced tests.

#### 🔹 **Types:**

* Assumption
* Inference
* Strengthening/Weakening arguments
* Cause and Effect

#### 🔹 **Approach:**

* Read carefully.
* Identify logical gap or implied meaning.
* Eliminate extreme or unrelated statements.
