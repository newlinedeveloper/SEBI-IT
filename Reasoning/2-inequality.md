## 🧠 **1. CONCEPT OF INEQUALITY**

Inequality problems test your ability to **compare relationships between variables** (like A, B, C, D) using **mathematical symbols**.

### 🔹 **Common Symbols and Meaning**

| Symbol | Meaning                  | Example | Interpretation                    |
| ------ | ------------------------ | ------- | --------------------------------- |
| `>`    | Greater than             | A > B   | A is greater than B               |
| `<`    | Less than                | A < B   | A is smaller than B               |
| `≥`    | Greater than or equal to | A ≥ B   | A is either greater or equal to B |
| `≤`    | Less than or equal to    | A ≤ B   | A is either smaller or equal to B |
| `=`    | Equal to                 | A = B   | A and B are equal                 |

### 🔹 **How Questions Are Asked**

You’ll be given **statements** and **conclusions**.

👉 **Task:** Decide whether the conclusion **definitely follows**, **does not follow**, or **cannot be determined**.

---

## 🧩 **2. BASIC RULES**

### 🔸 Rule 1: Combine Statements Only When Common Element Exists

Example:
**Given:** A > B = C < D
→ You can combine `A > B = C` and `C < D`
→ Thus: A > B = C < D → **A > C < D**
→ But you can’t directly compare **A and D**, because the direction changes (`>` then `<`).

So, **A ? D → No Relation** (Can’t be determined).

---

### 🔸 Rule 2: Same Direction Can Be Combined

If both symbols face the **same direction**, we can directly compare.

| Direction | Example           | Result |
| --------- | ----------------- | ------ |
| → (Right) | A > B > C         | A > C  |
| ← (Left)  | A < B < C         | A < C  |
| ≥ or ≤    | A ≥ B ≥ C → A ≥ C |        |
| Mixed     | A > B ≥ C → A > C |        |

---

### 🔸 Rule 3: Opposite Directions Cannot Be Combined

| Example   | Reason                                         |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| A > B < C | Direction changes → Can’t say A and C relation |
| A < B > C | Same → No definite relation                    |

---

### 🔸 Rule 4: Equality behaves as a bridge

If A = B and B > C → then **A > C** (you can substitute equal elements).

---

## 💡 **Symbol-Based Shortcuts (Very Useful)**

| Combination           | Result               |
| --------------------- | -------------------- |
| > or ≥                | “Definitely Greater” |
| < or ≤                | “Definitely Smaller” |
| =                     | “Equal”              |
| Opposite signs (>, <) | “No Relation”        |

## 🧾 **3. SAMPLE QUESTIONS WITH EXPLANATION**

---

### 🧩 **Q1.**

**Statements:** A > B = C < D
**Conclusion:** A ? D

✅ **Solution:**
→ A > B = C < D
→ Between A and D, direction changes (> and <).
So, **No definite relation**.

**Answer:** ❌ Cannot be determined.

---

### 🧩 **Q2.**

**Statements:** M ≥ N > O = P < Q
**Conclusion:** M ? Q

✅ **Solution:**
M ≥ N > O = P < Q
→ Between M and Q, direction changes (≥, >, <).
→ Can’t combine opposite directions.

**Answer:** ❌ No relation.

---

### 🧩 **Q3.**

**Statements:** A ≥ B > C
**Conclusion:** A > C

✅ **Solution:**
A ≥ B > C → all same direction → A > C (because one strict ‘>’ exists).
**Answer:** ✅ True.

---

### 🧩 **Q4.**

**Statements:** P < Q ≤ R = S
**Conclusions:**

1. P < R
2. Q ≤ S

✅ **Solution:**
1️⃣ P < Q ≤ R → same direction → P < R ✅
2️⃣ Q ≤ R = S → same direction → Q ≤ S ✅

**Answer:** ✅ Both conclusions follow.

---

### 🧩 **Q5.**

**Statements:** A = B ≥ C > D
**Conclusion:** A > D

✅ **Solution:**
A = B ≥ C > D → all same direction → A > D ✅
**Answer:** ✅ True.

---

### 🧩 **Q6.**

**Statements:** X > Y < Z
**Conclusion:** X ? Z

✅ **Solution:**
Direction changes (> and <), can’t combine.
**Answer:** ❌ No definite relation.

---

### 🧩 **Q7. (Reverse Inequality Type)**

**Statements:** A < B ≤ C
**Conclusions:**

1. C > A
2. A ≤ C

✅ **Solution:**
A < B ≤ C → all same direction → A < C ✅
Thus,
1️⃣ C > A → True
2️⃣ A ≤ C → Also True (since A < C implies ≤).

**Answer:** ✅ Both follow.

---

### 🧩 **Q8. (Either/Or Case)**

**Statements:** P ≥ Q, Q ≥ R
**Conclusions:**

1. P > R
2. P = R

✅ **Logic:**
→ If we can’t say which one is definitely true (may be > or =),
but **one of them must be true**, then we use “Either/Or.”

Here, between P and R → possible outcomes are (P > R or P = R).
Hence, **Either 1 or 2 follows** ✅

**Answer:** ✅ Either 1 or 2.

## 🧠 **4. HOW TO SOLVE IN 5 SECONDS**

1️⃣ **Write the elements horizontally** in sequence.
2️⃣ **Combine where direction same.**
3️⃣ **Break when direction changes.**
4️⃣ **Substitute = if same element.**
5️⃣ **Check conclusions carefully for “Either/Or” pattern.**
