## 🧩 **Topic 9: Time and Work**

### 🔹 Concept Recap

* **Work = Rate × Time**
* If A can do a work in **x days**, then in **1 day**, A does **1/x of the work**.
* If A and B work together, then **their combined 1 day’s work = (1/x + 1/y)**.
* If they work together for t days, then **Work done = t × (1/x + 1/y)**.
* **Efficiency ∝ 1 / Time taken**.

### 1.

A can complete a task in 10 days. How much work does A do in one day?
**Solution:**
1 day’s work = 1/10 of total work ✅

---

### 2.

B can finish a work in 8 days. Find how much work he completes in 2 days.
**Solution:**
1 day’s work = 1/8
→ 2 days = 2/8 = 1/4 ✅

---

### 3.

A can do a job in 6 days; B can do it in 12 days. How long will both take together?
**Solution:**
A’s 1-day work = 1/6, B’s = 1/12
Together = 1/6 + 1/12 = 1/4 → **4 days** ✅

---

### 4.

A does a piece of work in 5 days, B in 10 days. How long together?
**Solution:**
1/5 + 1/10 = 3/10 → Time = 10/3 = **3⅓ days** ✅

---

### 5.

A alone can finish in 12 days, B in 6 days. How long together?
**Solution:**
1/12 + 1/6 = 3/12 = 1/4 → **4 days** ✅

---

### 6.

A does ½ work in 5 days. How much time for full work?
**Solution:**
½ → 5 days ⇒ full → 10 days ✅

---

### 7.

A and B together can finish a task in 8 days. A alone can in 12 days. In how many days can B do it alone?
**Solution:**
A’s 1-day = 1/12; together = 1/8
→ B’s = 1/8 – 1/12 = 1/24 → **24 days** ✅

---

### 8.

A can do a work in 15 days, B in 20. How long together?
**Solution:**
1/15 + 1/20 = 7/60 → Time = 60/7 ≈ **8.57 days** ✅

---

**Solution:**
⅔ → 8 days ⇒ 1 → 8 × 3/2 = **12 days** ✅

---

### 10.

A can complete a work in 25 days. How much of the work will A finish in 5 days?
**Solution:**
5/25 = **1/5 of work** ✅

---

### 11.

A can do a job in 16 days. B takes twice the time. How long together?
**Solution:**
B = 32 days; 1/16 + 1/32 = 3/32 → Time = **10⅔ days** ✅

---

### 12.

A can do in 6 days, B in 8, C in 12. Together?
**Solution:**
1/6 + 1/8 + 1/12 = (4+3+2)/24 = 9/24 = 3/8 → Time = **8/3 days** ✅

---

### 13.

A can complete in 10 days, B can destroy same work in 20 days. If both work together?
**Solution:**
A = +1/10, B = –1/20
Net = 1/10 – 1/20 = 1/20 → **20 days** ✅

---

### 14.

A is twice as efficient as B. Together finish in 12 days. How long will A take alone?
**Solution:**
Let B = 1x, A = 2x → total = 3x in 1/12
So 3x = 1/12 ⇒ x = 1/36 ⇒ A = 1/18 → **18 days** ✅

---

### 15.

A and B together can finish in 10 days. A alone takes 15 days. Find B’s time.
**Solution:**
1/10 – 1/15 = 1/30 → **30 days** ✅

---

### 16.

A can do ¾ of a job in 9 days. Find full time.
**Solution:**
¾ → 9 days ⇒ 1 → 9 × 4/3 = **12 days** ✅

---

### 17.

A and B can do a piece of work in 30 and 20 days respectively. Find together time.
**Solution:**
1/30 + 1/20 = 1/12 → **12 days** ✅

---

### 18.

A can do in 8 days, B in 12 days. After 3 days, A leaves. Find remaining days for B.
**Solution:**
A+B = 1/8 + 1/12 = 5/24
3 days work = 15/24 = 5/8 → 3/8 left
B = 1/12 → 3/8 × 12 = **4.5 days** ✅

---

### 19.

A can complete in 10 days, B in 15. If both work 5 days, what fraction left?
**Solution:**
1/10 + 1/15 = 1/6 → 5 days = 5/6 done → **1/6 left** ✅

---

### 20.

A and B can do a work in 9 and 12 days respectively. In how many days A alone will finish what B does in 2 days?
**Solution:**
B’s 2 days = 2/12 = 1/6
A’s rate = 1/9 ⇒ time = (1/6)/(1/9) = **1.5 days** ✅

---

### 21.

If A is 50% more efficient than B, and B can finish in 12 days, A’s time?
**Solution:**
Efficiency ratio A:B = 3:2 ⇒ Time ratio = 2:3 ⇒ A = 8 days ✅

---

### 22.

A alone can do in 18 days, B 15. If A works 6 days, B finishes rest. Total time?
**Solution:**
A’s 6 days = 6/18 = 1/3 → 2/3 left
B = 1/15 → (2/3)/(1/15) = 10 → Total = 16 days ✅

---

## ⚙️ **10 Moderate-Level Application Problems**

---

### 1.

A and B can do a piece of work in 15 days; B and C in 20 days; A and C in 30 days. In how many days will all three complete it?
**Solution:**
Add (A+B)+(B+C)+(A+C)=2(A+B+C)
→ (1/15+1/20+1/30)=1/6 ⇒ 2(A+B+C)=1/6 ⇒ A+B+C=1/12 → **12 days** ✅

---

### 2.

A can do in 20 days, B in 30, C in 60. They start together but C leaves after 5 days. How long to finish?
**Solution:**
Combined rate initially = 1/20+1/30+1/60=1/10
5 days → ½ done
Remaining ½ → A+B = 1/20+1/30=1/12 → Time=6 → **Total 11 days** ✅

---

### 3.

A is thrice as efficient as B. A can complete work in 30 days less than B. Find both times.
**Solution:**
Let B=x days ⇒ A=x/3
x – x/3 = 30 ⇒ (2x/3)=30 ⇒ x=45 ⇒ A=15 ✅

---

### 4.

A and B can finish in 10 and 15 days. They work alternately starting with A. Find total days.
**Solution:**
2 days work = 1/10+1/15=1/6
→ 6 days = full ⇒ **6 days** ✅

---

### 5.

A and B together can do in 12 days. A is 50% more efficient than B. Find days individually.
**Solution:**
Efficiency A:B=3:2 ⇒ Time=8:12 ⇒ A=8, B=12 ✅

---

### 6.

A can complete ⅔ work in 12 days. With help of B, remaining work finished in 3 days. B alone can complete whole work in?
**Solution:**
A = ⅔ in 12 ⇒ full = 18 days
Remaining ⅓ done by A+B in 3 days
3(1/18+B)=⅓ ⇒ B=1/9 → **9 days** ✅

---

### 7.

3 men or 6 women can do a job in 16 days. Find how long 2 men and 3 women will take.
**Solution:**
3M=6W ⇒ 1M=2W
2M+3W=7W ⇒ ratio=6:7 ⇒ 16×6/7=**13.7 days** ✅

---

### 8.

A can do a work in 5 days less than B. Together they take 6 days. Find time individually.
**Solution:**
x(x–5)/(x+x–5)=6 ⇒ x=15 ⇒ A=10 days ✅

---

### 9.

P and Q can do a work in 8 and 12 days. R joins them, and together they finish in 4 days. How long R alone?
**Solution:**
1/8+1/12+1/R=1/4 ⇒ 5/24+1/R=1/4 ⇒ 1/R=1/24 ⇒ **24 days** ✅

---

### 10.

A, B, and C together can complete work in 10 days. A alone takes 15 days, B twice as fast as C. Find B and C’s time.
**Solution:**
1/10=1/15+1/B+1/C; B=2C ⇒ 1/B=1/2C
⇒ 1/10–1/15=1/2C+1/C=3/2C ⇒ 1/30=3/2C ⇒ C=45 ⇒ B=22.5 ✅
