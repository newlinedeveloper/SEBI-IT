## 📊 **13. Data Interpretation (DI)**

### 🧩 **Concept**

Data Interpretation involves analyzing **numerical data** presented in various forms — **tables, charts, and graphs** — and answering questions based on **percentages, ratios, averages, and differences**.

It’s one of the **highest-scoring topics** in banking, SSC, and aptitude exams — provided you calculate efficiently and interpret data correctly.

### 🔹 **Common Types of DI Questions**

| Type               | Description                            | Example                          |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **1. Table Chart** | Data in rows & columns                 | Company profits from 2019–2023   |
| **2. Bar Graph**   | Compare multiple quantities            | Sales of products A, B, C        |
| **3. Line Graph**  | Trends over time                       | Yearly income of two firms       |
| **4. Pie Chart**   | Percent distribution                   | Expense distribution of a family |
| **5. Caselet**     | Paragraph-based data (no direct chart) | "A company has 4 departments..." |

### 🔹 **Key Formulas & Shortcuts**

1. **Percentage:**
   [
   \text{Percentage Change} = \frac{\text{New} - \text{Old}}{\text{Old}} \times 100
   ]

2. **Ratio:**
   [
   \text{Ratio} = \frac{\text{Part 1}}{\text{Part 2}}
   ]

3. **Average:**
   [
   \text{Average} = \frac{\text{Sum of values}}{\text{Number of values}}
   ]

4. **Difference:**
   [
   \text{Difference} = \text{Greater Value} - \text{Smaller Value}
   ]

5. **Angle in Pie Chart:**
   [
   \text{Angle} = \frac{\text{Category Value}}{\text{Total Value}} \times 360°
   ]

### 🔹 **Example 1: Table-Based DI**

| Year | Revenue (₹ crore) | Expense (₹ crore) |
| ---- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| 2021 | 120               | 80                |
| 2022 | 150               | 100               |
| 2023 | 180               | 120               |

**Q1:** Find the profit % in 2022.
Profit = 150 − 100 = 50
[
\text{Profit %} = \frac{50}{100} \times 100 = 50%
]

**Q2:** Find average revenue over 3 years.
[
\frac{120 + 150 + 180}{3} = 450/3 = 150
]

---

### 🔹 **Example 2: Pie Chart DI**

**A company’s annual expenditure of ₹5,00,000 is distributed as follows:**

| Category  | % of total |
| --------- | ---------- |
| Rent      | 20%        |
| Salaries  | 40%        |
| Utilities | 15%        |
| Marketing | 25%        |

**Q:** What is the amount spent on Marketing?
[
= 25% \times 5,00,000 = 1,25,000
]

**Q:** Angle for Utilities sector in pie chart?
[
= \frac{15}{100} \times 360 = 54°
]

---

### 🔹 **Example 3: Bar Graph**

Sales (in ₹ lakh):

| Product | 2023 | 2024 |
| ------- | ---- | ---- |
| A       | 30   | 45   |
| B       | 20   | 25   |
| C       | 40   | 50   |

**Q1:** % increase in A’s sales from 2023 to 2024?
[
= \frac{45 - 30}{30} \times 100 = 50%
]

**Q2:** Average sales in 2024?
[
= \frac{45 + 25 + 50}{3} = 120 / 3 = 40
]

---

### 🔹 **Example 4: Line Graph**

| Year | Company X | Company Y |
| ---- | --------- | --------- |
| 2020 | 60        | 80        |
| 2021 | 70        | 90        |
| 2022 | 100       | 110       |

**Q:** In which year was the growth of Company X maximum?
→ (70−60)=10, (100−70)=30 ⇒ **2022**

**Q:** Combined income in 2021?
→ 70 + 90 = **160**

### 🔹 **Example 5: Caselet**

A school has 1200 students.
40% are boys.
60% of the boys and 50% of the girls passed the exam.

**Q:** Find total students who passed.

Boys = 40% of 1200 = 480
Girls = 1200 − 480 = 720

Passed boys = 60% of 480 = 288
Passed girls = 50% of 720 = 360
✅ **Total passed = 288 + 360 = 648**

### 🧠 **Tips to Solve DI Quickly**

1. **Approximate smartly:** Round off values for quick calculations.
2. **Use ratios instead of exact numbers** when comparing.
3. **Use mental math**: memorize common percentage–fraction equivalents (e.g. 1/3 = 33.33%).
4. **Look for patterns**: increases, decreases, averages.
5. **Avoid over-reading:** focus only on the question requirement.

### 💪 **Practice Drill (Try Mentally)**

1. Revenue = ₹200, Expense = ₹150 → Profit % = ?
   → (50/150)×100 = **33.33%**

2. Pie chart shows 25% for Marketing → total = ₹4,00,000 → Marketing = ?
   → 1,00,000 ✅

3. Average of 40, 50, 60, 70 = ?
   → 220/4 = **55**

4. Value increases from 80 → 100 → % change?
   → (20/80)×100 = **25%**

5. Angle for 20% section in pie chart?
   → (20/100)×360 = **72°**

### 📘 **Quick Summary Table**

| Formula                       | Use            |
| ----------------------------- | -------------- |
| % Change = (New–Old)/Old ×100 | Growth/decline |
| Average = Sum/N               | Mean value     |
| Ratio = A/B                   | Comparison     |
| Angle = Value/Total × 360     | Pie chart      |
| % Value = (Part/Total)×100    | Percentages    |
