### **1. Simplification & Approximation**

**Concept:**
These problems test your calculation speed and accuracy. You‚Äôll solve expressions using BODMAS, fractions, decimals, percentages, roots, and approximations.

**Key Areas:**

* BODMAS rule
* Squares, cubes, and roots
* Percentage and fraction conversions
* Approximating large numbers
* Simplifying long arithmetic expressions

**Example:**
( (15.8 \times 4.9) + (99.9 √∑ 9.98) ‚âà ? )

**Tip:**
Memorize squares (1‚Äì30), cubes (1‚Äì20), and common percentage‚Äìfraction equivalents.

---

### **2. Number Series**

**Concept:**
Identify the pattern in a sequence of numbers ‚Äî could be arithmetic, geometric, or based on a mathematical operation.

**Types:**

* Increasing/decreasing pattern
* Alternating pattern
* Square/cube-based
* Multiplication/division pattern
* Difference pattern
* Missing number or wrong number in the series

**Example:**
2, 6, 12, 20, 30, ?
(Differences: +4, +6, +8, +10 ‚Üí next +12 ‚áí 42)

---

### **3. Number System**

**Concept:**
Covers properties and classification of numbers ‚Äî foundation for all arithmetic topics.

**Key Concepts:**

* Types of numbers (natural, integers, rational, irrational, etc.)
* Divisibility rules
* Factors and multiples
* HCF & LCM
* Remainder and unit digit concepts
* Place value and face value

**Example:**
Find the remainder when ( 7^{103} ) is divided by 6.

---

### **4. Quadratic Equations**

**Concept:**
You solve quadratic equations and compare two variables.

**Types:**

* Factorization method
* Completing the square
* Using quadratic formula
* Comparing roots of two equations

**Example:**

1. ( x^2 + 5x + 6 = 0 ) ‚Üí x = -2, -3
2. ( y^2 + 7y + 10 = 0 ) ‚Üí y = -2, -5
   Compare x and y.

---

### **5. Ratio and Proportion**

**Concept:**
Understanding the relationship between quantities.

**Key Formulas:**

* Ratio = a:b
* Proportion = a/b = c/d
* Compound ratio and continued proportion
* Direct and inverse variation

**Example:**
If A:B = 2:3 and B:C = 4:5, find A:C.

---

### **6. Percentage**

**Concept:**
Foundation for profit & loss, SI/CI, and DI questions.

**Key Concepts:**

* Basic % formula: (Value/Total) √ó 100
* Increase/decrease %
* Successive percentage changes
* % comparison problems

**Example:**
If the price of a shirt increases by 20% and then decreases by 10%, what is the net % change?

---

### **7. Profit and Loss**

**Concept:**
Based on cost price (CP), selling price (SP), and profit/loss percentage.

**Formulas:**

* Profit = SP ‚Äì CP
* Loss = CP ‚Äì SP
* Profit % = (Profit/CP) √ó 100

**Example:**
A man buys a book for ‚Çπ400 and sells it for ‚Çπ480. Find profit %.

---

### **8. Simple Interest (SI) & Compound Interest (CI)**

**Concept:**
Questions on calculating interest on money over time.

**Formulas:**

* SI = (P √ó R √ó T)/100
* CI = P √ó [(1 + R/100)^T ‚Äì 1]

**Example:**
Find the CI on ‚Çπ10,000 for 2 years at 10% per annum.

---

### **9. Time and Work**

**Concept:**
Work done is inversely proportional to time when efficiency is constant.

**Formulas:**

* Work = Rate √ó Time
* If A can do a work in x days ‚Üí 1 day's work = 1/x

**Example:**
A can complete a work in 10 days, B in 15 days. Together they work for 5 days. How much work is left?

---

### **10. Pipes and Cistern**

**Concept:**
Same as time & work ‚Äî deals with filling/emptying tanks.

**Example:**
A pipe fills a tank in 6 hrs, another empties it in 8 hrs. Find time to fill the tank together.

---

### **11. Time and Distance**

**Concept:**
Relates speed, distance, and time.

**Formula:**
Speed = Distance / Time

**Example:**
A car travels 120 km in 3 hours. Find its speed.

**Subtopics:**

* Relative speed
* Trains and boats problems
* Average speed

---

### **12. Mixture and Alligation**

**Concept:**
Mixing two or more ingredients with different concentrations or costs.

**Formula:**
[
\frac{Q_1}{Q_2} = \frac{D_2}{D_1}
]
(Difference method)

**Example:**
A 30% acid solution is mixed with a 50% acid solution to get 40%. Find the ratio.

---

### **13. Data Interpretation (DI)**

**Concept:**
Analyze data presented in charts, graphs, or tables and answer percentage/ratio-based questions.

**Types:**

* Bar graph
* Line graph
* Pie chart
* Table
* Caselet (paragraph-based)

**Key Skills:**
Quick calculations using ratio, percentage, average.
