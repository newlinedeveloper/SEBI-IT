## 📊 **Percentage — Complete Guide**

---

### 🔹 **1. Concept Overview**

A **percentage (%)** is simply a **fraction out of 100**.
[
\text{Percentage} = \left(\frac{\text{Value}}{\text{Total}}\right) × 100
]

✅ Example:
If 45 out of 60 students passed,
[
\text{Percentage} = (45/60)×100 = 75%
]

---

### 🔹 **2. Converting Between Fractions, Decimals & Percentages**

| Fraction | Decimal | Percentage |
| -------- | ------- | ---------- |
| 1/2      | 0.5     | 50%        |
| 1/3      | 0.333   | 33⅓%       |
| 1/4      | 0.25    | 25%        |
| 1/5      | 0.2     | 20%        |
| 3/4      | 0.75    | 75%        |
| 1/8      | 0.125   | 12.5%      |
| 1/10     | 0.1     | 10%        |

💡 **Tip:** Memorize these — they appear constantly in exams.

### 🔹 **3. Percentage Increase / Decrease**

| Type         | Formula                 |
| ------------ | ----------------------- |
| **Increase** | New = Old × (1 + p/100) |
| **Decrease** | New = Old × (1 − p/100) |

**Example:**
If a book price increases by 20%,
Old = ₹100 → New = 100×1.2 = ₹120 ✅

If it decreases by 10%,
New = 100×0.9 = ₹90 ✅

---

### 🔹 **4. Net Percentage Change (Successive % Changes)**

When two changes occur successively:
[
\text{Net % Change} = a + b + \frac{ab}{100}
]

**Example:**
If a shirt price increases by 20% and then decreases by 10%:
[
20 + (-10) + \frac{20×(-10)}{100} = 10 − 2 = 8%
]
✅ **Net +8% increase**

If both are decreases:
[
-20 + (-10) + \frac{(-20)×(-10)}{100} = -30 + 2 = -28%
]
✅ **Net 28% decrease**

---

### 🔹 **5. Percentage Comparison**

To compare values A & B:
[
% \text{change} = \frac{\text{Difference}}{\text{Original}} × 100
]

**Example:**
A = 60, B = 75 → % increase = (15/60)×100 = 25%

---

### 🔹 **6. Reverse Percentage (Finding Original Value)**

If a value **increases by p%** and becomes **New**,
then
[
\text{Old} = \frac{\text{New} × 100}{100 + p}
]

**Example:**
After a 20% rise, price = ₹120 → Original = 120×100/120 = ₹100 ✅

---

### 🔹 **7. Population or Compound Change Formula**

If a population grows by **r% per year** for **n years**:
[
\text{Population after n years} = P \times (1 + \frac{r}{100})^n
]
If it decreases each year:
[
P \times (1 - \frac{r}{100})^n
]

### ✅ **Solutions (Moderate-Level)**

1️⃣ (6000/40000)×100 = 15%
2️⃣ Earlier ₹10/kg → 90% price = ₹9/kg → 900/9 = 100 kg
3️⃣ Let B=x → A=1.25x → x+1.25x=225 → x=100 → A=125, B=100
4️⃣ 120% = 180 → 100% = 150
5️⃣ 15 + 10 + (15×10)/100 = 26.5%
6️⃣ 50,000×(1.1)³ = 66,550
7️⃣ +25 + (-20) + (25×-20)/100 = 0 → **No net change!**
8️⃣ If spends 80%, saves 20% → 20% = 2000 → 100% = ₹10,000
9️⃣ 40A = 60B → A:B = 3:2
10️⃣ (40/140)×100 = 28.57%
