## ⚖️ **Ratio and Proportion — Complete Guide**

---

### 🔹 **1. Concept Overview**

**Ratio** and **Proportion** express **relationships** between quantities.
They’re widely used to compare, scale, and distribute values.

---

### 🔹 **2. Ratio — The Basic Relationship**

If two numbers are **a** and **b**, their **ratio** is written as
[
a : b \text{ or } \frac{a}{b}
]

**Examples:**

* Ratio of 2 kg to 500 g = 2 : 0.5 = 4 : 1
* Ratio of ₹60 to ₹1.5 = 60 : 1.5 = 40 : 1

✅ **Key point:** Always **convert units** before forming ratios.

---

### 🔹 **3. Properties of Ratio**

1️⃣ Multiplying/dividing both terms by the same number doesn’t change the ratio.
[
4 : 6 = 2 : 3
]

2️⃣ Ratios are **dimensionless** — they only represent relationships, not actual values.

---

### 🔹 **4. Proportion**

If two ratios are equal, they form a **proportion**:
[
a : b :: c : d \quad \text{or} \quad \frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d}
]

→ Here, **a & d** are **extremes**, **b & c** are **means**.
→ Product of means = Product of extremes
[
a \times d = b \times c
]

✅ **Example:**
If 2 : 3 :: 8 : 12, then 2×12 = 3×8 → 24 = 24 ✔️

---

### 🔹 **5. Compound Ratio**

If (a:b) and (c:d) are two ratios,
then their **compound ratio** is ( (a×c) : (b×d) ).

**Example:**
If A:B = 2:3 and B:C = 4:5
then A:C = (2×4):(3×5) = 8:15 ✅

---

### 🔹 **6. Continued Proportion**

If a, b, c are in continued proportion,
then ( \frac{a}{b} = \frac{b}{c} )
⇒ ( b^2 = ac )

**Example:**
If a = 2, c = 8 → b² = 2×8 = 16 → b = 4 ✅

---

### 🔹 **7. Direct & Inverse Variation**

| Type                  | Relationship                          | Example         |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| **Direct Variation**  | Increase in one → Increase in another | Cost ∝ Quantity |
| **Inverse Variation** | Increase in one → Decrease in another | Speed ∝ 1/Time  |

**Example (Direct):**
If 5 pens cost ₹25, then 8 pens cost ₹(25×8)/5 = ₹40

**Example (Inverse):**
If 4 men can finish work in 12 days,
then 6 men will take = (4×12)/6 = 8 days ✅

---

### 🔹 **8. Key Formula Summary**

| Concept                                | Formula       |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| Product of means = product of extremes | a×d = b×c     |
| Compound ratio                         | (a×c):(b×d)   |
| Continued proportion                   | b² = ac       |
| Direct variation                       | x₁/y₁ = x₂/y₂ |
| Inverse variation                      | x₁×y₁ = x₂×y₂ |
