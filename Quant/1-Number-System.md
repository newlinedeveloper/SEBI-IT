### 🔹 **1. Concept Overview**

The Number System forms the **base of all arithmetic**.
It includes understanding **different types of numbers**, **divisibility**, **remainders**, and **factors/LCM/HCF** — all of which appear directly or indirectly in other chapters like Simplification, Ratio, and DI.

### 🔹 **2. Types of Numbers**

| Type                     | Examples                     | Description                             |

### 🔹 **3. Divisibility Rules**

| Number | Rule                                                       |
| ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **2**  | Last digit even (0, 2, 4, 6, 8)                            |
| **3**  | Sum of digits divisible by 3                               |
| **4**  | Last 2 digits form a number divisible by 4                 |

**Example:**
Is 672 divisible by 8?
→ Last 3 digits = 672 → 672 ÷ 8 = 84 ✔️ (Yes)

---

### 🔹 **4. Factors and Multiples**

* **Factor:** Divides the number exactly (no remainder)
  Ex: Factors of 12 → 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12
* **Multiple:** Obtained by multiplying a number by integers
  Ex: Multiples of 6 → 6, 12, 18, 24, 30…

---

### 🔹 **5. HCF (Highest Common Factor) & LCM (Lowest Common Multiple)**

**Formulas:**
[
\text{HCF × LCM = Product of the two numbers}
]

**Steps:**

1. Write prime factorization
   Ex: 12 = 2² × 3, 18 = 2 × 3²
2. **HCF** = product of smallest powers of common primes = 2¹ × 3¹ = 6
3. **LCM** = product of highest powers = 2² × 3² = 36

✅ **Example:**
Find HCF and LCM of 18 and 24.
→ 18 = 2 × 3²
→ 24 = 2³ × 3¹
→ HCF = 2¹ × 3¹ = 6
→ LCM = 2³ × 3² = 72

---

### 🔹 **6. Remainder Concepts**

When dividing numbers, you can use **modulus arithmetic** (mod).

**Key Properties:**

* (a + b) mod n = [(a mod n) + (b mod n)] mod n
* (a × b) mod n = [(a mod n) × (b mod n)] mod n

**Example:**
Find the remainder when 7¹⁰³ is divided by 6.

💡 Step:

* 7 mod 6 = 1
* (7¹⁰³ mod 6) = (1¹⁰³ mod 6) = 1
  ✅ **Remainder = 1**

---

### 🔹 **7. Unit Digit Concept**

Used when you want the **last digit** of a large power.

**Example:**
Find the unit digit of (7^{103}).

Pattern of 7’s powers:
7¹=7, 7²=49→9, 7³=343→3, 7⁴=2401→1 → repeats every 4 terms.
103 ÷ 4 → remainder 3 → So unit digit = 3rd term = **3**

---

### 🔹 **8. Place Value vs Face Value**

| Concept         | Example (in 5324)                                     |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Face Value**  | Value of the digit itself → e.g., face value of 3 = 3 |
| **Place Value** | Digit × its place (10s, 100s) → 3 × 100 = 300         |

## Solutions — Concept Questions

1. Classify:

* a) (0) → **Whole number** (Whole), also an Integer and Rational (0 = 0/1).
* b) (\sqrt{2}) → **Irrational** (non-terminating, non-repeating decimal).
* c) (-5) → **Integer** (also rational).
* d) (\dfrac{7}{3}) → **Rational** (fraction).

2. Is 1 prime? **No.** Prime numbers have exactly two distinct positive divisors (1 and itself). The number 1 has only one divisor (1), so it's neither prime nor composite.

3. 121 = (11\times11 = 11^2). So **composite**, prime factorization (11^2).

4. Divisibility for 7,452:

* By 3: sum of digits (7+4+5+2=18). 18 divisible by 3 ⇒ **yes divisible by 3**.
* By 9: sum = 18, 18 divisible by 9 ⇒ **yes divisible by 9**.
* By 11: (sum of alternate digits) = (7 + 5) − (4 + 2) = 12 − 6 = 6. 6 not divisible by 11 ⇒ **not divisible by 11**.

5. Units digit of (2^{15}). Powers of 2 units pattern: 2,4,8,6 (cycle length 4).
   15 mod 4 = 3 → 3rd term = 8. **Units digit = 8**.

6. Units digit of (9^{100}). Units pattern for 9: 9,1 (cycle 2). 100 mod 2 = 0 → corresponds to 2nd term = 1. **Units digit = 1**.

7. Remainder when 12345 divided by 9: sum digits = 1+2+3+4+5=15. 15 mod 9 = 6. So remainder **6**.

8. Remainder when (7^{103}) divided by 6: Since (7 \equiv 1 \pmod{6}), (7^{103}\equiv 1^{103}\equiv 1\pmod{6}). **Remainder = 1**.

9. Units digit of (7^{103}). Cycle for 7: 7,9,3,1 (length 4). 103 mod 4 = 3 → 3rd term = **3**.

10. HCF of 36 and 60. Prime factorization: 36 = (2^2\cdot3^2); 60 = (2^2\cdot3\cdot5). HCF = product of smallest powers of common primes = (2^2\cdot3^1 = 4\cdot3=12). **HCF = 12**.

11. LCM of 15, 20, 30. Factorize: 15 = (3\cdot5); 20 = (2^2\cdot5); 30 = (2\cdot3\cdot5). LCM = highest powers: (2^2\cdot3\cdot5 = 4\cdot3\cdot5=60). **LCM = 60**.

12. Check HCF×LCM for 12 and 18. 12 = (2^2\cdot3); 18 = (2\cdot3^2). HCF = (2\cdot3 = 6). LCM = (2^2\cdot3^2 = 36). Product = (6\times36 = 216). Product of numbers 12×18 = 216. So equality holds: **216**.

13. Prime factors of 210. 210 = 21×10 = (3×7)×(2×5) → primes: **2, 3, 5, 7**; prime factorization (2\cdot3\cdot5\cdot7).

14. Number of positive divisors of 360. Factorize 360 = (2^3\cdot3^2\cdot5^1). Number of divisors = ((3+1)(2+1)(1+1)=4\cdot3\cdot2=24). **24 divisors**.

15. If digits sum to 27 → divisible by 9? Yes because 27 is multiple of 9. So **divisible by 9**.

16. Face and place value of 6 in 56,743. Face value = 6. Place value: 6 is in the thousands place (5 6 7 4 3? Wait — check positions). Number 56,743 digits: 5(ten-thousands), 6(thousands), 7(hundreds), 4(tens), 3(ones). Place value = 6 × 1000 = **6000**.

17. Remainder when 1001 divided by 7. 1001 = 7×143 exactly → remainder **0**.

18. Divisible by 8? For 2040: check last 3 digits 040 = 40. 40 ÷ 8 = 5 exactly ⇒ divisible by 8. **Yes**.

19. If (a\equiv 3 \pmod{5}) and (b\equiv 4 \pmod{5}) then (a+b\equiv 3+4\equiv 7\equiv 2\pmod{5}). So **2 mod 5**.

20. Remainder when (2^{10}) divided by 11. Use Fermat-like reduction or compute: powers of 2 mod 11:
    2¹=2, 2²=4, 2³=8, 2⁴=16≡5, 2⁵≡10, 2⁶≡20≡9, 2⁷≡18≡7, 2⁸≡14≡3, 2⁹≡6, 2¹⁰≡12≡1. So remainder **1**.

21. Smallest prime factor of 91. 91 = 7×13 → smallest prime factor **7**.

22. If divisible by 4 and 6 does it imply divisible by 12? Not always. If n divisible by both 4 and 6, then n divisible by LCM(4,6) = 12. So **yes** it is divisible by 12. (Because LCM(4,6)=12.)

23. 84 as product of prime powers: 84 = 2² × 3 × 7.

24. If units digit is 0, the number is divisible by 2 and by 5 (and therefore by 10). So **divisible by both 2 and 5**.

25. True/False: Every prime number is odd. **False.** 2 is prime and even.

## Solutions — Moderate Problems

### Moderate 1

**Find remainder when (3^{2025}) divided by 8.**

Powers of 3 mod 8:
3¹ ≡ 3
3² ≡ 9 ≡ 1 (mod 8)
So cycle length = 2. 2025 mod 2 = 1 ⇒ (3^{2025} \equiv 3^1 \equiv 3 \pmod{8}).
**Remainder = 3.**

### Moderate 2

**Units digit of (13^{201}).**

Units digit depends only on units digit 3. Powers of 3 units cycle: 3,9,7,1 (length 4). 201 mod 4 = 1 → units digit = 3. **Answer: 3.**

### Moderate 3

**Remainder when (2^{50}+3^{50}) divided by 5.**

Compute each mod 5:

* 2 mod5 =2. Powers of 2 mod5 cycle: 2,4,3,1 (length 4). 50 mod4 = 2 ⇒ (2^{50} \equiv) 2nd = 4 (mod5).
* 3 mod5 =3. Powers of 3 mod5 cycle: 3,4,2,1 (length 4). 50 mod4 = 2 ⇒ (3^{50} \equiv) 4 (mod5).
  Sum ≡ 4+4 = 8 ≡ 3 (mod5). **Remainder = 3.**

### Moderate 4

**Two numbers have LCM 360 and HCF 6. One number is 54. Find the other number.**

Let numbers be (a) and (b). We know (a\times b = \text{HCF}\times \text{LCM}). So (54\times b = 6\times 360 = 2160). Thus (b = 2160/54). Compute 2160 ÷ 54 = 40. **Other number = 40.**

(Alternatively using prime factors: 54 = (2\times3^3); HCF 6 = (2\times3) ⇒ dividing 54 by HCF gives (3^2=9); multiply 9 by LCM/HCF? But above direct formula is easiest.)

### Moderate 5

**Find smallest positive integer (n) divisible by 2,3,4,5,6.**

We need LCM(2,3,4,5,6). Factorizations:

* 2 = 2
* 3 = 3
* 4 = (2^2)
* 5 = 5
* 6 = 2×3
  Take highest powers: (2^2, 3^1, 5^1) → LCM = 4×3×5 = 60. **Smallest n = 60.**

### Moderate 6

**Find smallest positive (x) with: (x\equiv1\pmod2), (x\equiv2\pmod3), (x\equiv3\pmod5).**

We can check residues or solve systematically.

List numbers ≡3 mod 5: 3, 8, 13, 18, 23, 28, 33, 38, 43, 48...
We need those that are ≡2 mod 3 and ≡1 mod 2 (i.e., odd).

Check:

* 3: mod3 = 0 → no.
* 8: mod3 = 2, but 8 mod2 = 0 → even ⇒ fails x≡1 mod2.
* 13: mod3 = 1 → fail.
* 18: mod3=0 → fail.
* 23: mod3 = 2 and 23 mod2 = 1 → matches all three. So **x = 23** is smallest.

(We could also solve pairwise: x=3+5k; require 3+5k ≡2 mod3 ⇒ (3+5k) mod3 ≡0+2k ≡2 ⇒ 2k≡2 ⇒ k≡1 mod3 ⇒ k=1+3t ⇒ x=3+5(1+3t)=8+15t. Now require x odd: 8+15t odd ⇒ 8 even, 15t parity same as t; need t odd ⇒ t=1 gives x=23.)

### Moderate 7

**Last two digits of (7^{20}).**

We want modulo 100. Use Euler's theorem: φ(100)=40, but 7 and 100 are coprime so (7^{40}\equiv1\pmod{100}). 20 is half of 40, so not directly 1. We can compute by successive squaring mod100:

Compute powers:

* (7^1 = 7)
* (7^2 = 49)
* (7^4 = 49^2 = 2401\equiv 1 \pmod{100}) because 2401 mod100 = 1.
  So (7^4\equiv1\pmod{100}). Then (7^{20} = (7^4)^5 \equiv 1^5 \equiv 1 \pmod{100}).
  **Last two digits: 01.**

(Observation: 7^4 = 2401 ends with 01, so any multiple of power 4 will end with 01.)

### Moderate 8

**Three numbers pairwise relatively prime. Product = (2\cdot3\cdot5\cdot7\cdot11\cdot13). One number is 10. Find the other two.**

Given product of three pairwise-coprime numbers equals 2·3·5·7·11·13. One number 10 = 2·5. Since numbers are pairwise relatively prime, no prime factor can be shared among different numbers. But 10 uses primes 2 and 5, so none of the other numbers can have 2 or 5. So remove 2 and 5 from the product: remaining primes product = 3·7·11·13 = 3003. We need to split 3003 into two pairwise-coprime numbers using distinct primes — simplest is take one as product of some primes and the other as product of remaining primes. Many splits possible; they asked “find the other two numbers” — likely they mean the natural split into two numbers using remaining prime grouping. Reasonable choice: take 3·7 = 21 and 11·13 = 143. Both 21 and 143 are coprime to each other and to 10 (since they don't use 2 or 5). So one possible solution: **10, 21, 143**. (Any other partition of {3,7,11,13} into two groups works.)

### Moderate 9

**Remainder when (11^{97}) divided by 10.**

Remainder mod 10 is the last digit. 11 ≡ 1 (mod 10). So (11^{97} \equiv 1^{97} \equiv 1 \pmod{10}). **Remainder = 1** (last digit 1).

### Moderate 10

**A 4-digit number divisible by 9 and 5. What are all possible last two digits?**

Divisible by 5 ⇒ last digit is 0 or 5. Divisible by 9 ⇒ sum of digits divisible by 9.

But any 4-digit number divisible by 5 and 9 must be divisible by LCM(5,9)=45. So asking last two digits of numbers divisible by 45. Numbers divisible by 45 must be divisible by 5 and 9; divisibility by 5 forces last digit 0 or 5. For divisibility by 9 and 5 simultaneously, the two-digit suffix must be such that whole number divisible by 9 given thousands/hundreds etc. However we can reason: any number divisible by 45 is divisible by 5 → last digit 0 or 5. Also divisible by 9 → sum of digits multiple of 9. But the set of possible last two digits for multiples of 45 repeats every 100 (because adding 100 won't affect divisibility by 5 but will change sum; careful). Simpler: List all two-digit multiples of 45 under 100 as candidates for last two digits of a 4-digit multiple of 45.

Multiples of 45: 45, 90, 135, 180, 225, 270, 315, 360, 405, 450, ... Last two digits cycle through:

* 45 → last two digits 45
* 90 → 90
* 135 → 35
* 180 → 80
* 225 → 25
* 270 → 70
* 315 → 15
* 360 → 60
* 405 → 05
* 450 → 50
* 495 → 95
* 540 → 40
* 585 → 85
* 630 → 30
* 675 → 75
* 720 → 20
* 765 → 65
* 810 → 10
* 855 → 55
* 900 → 00

So the last two digits that appear among multiples of 45 are every multiple-of-5 pair where the number itself is multiple of 9 as well. But the set of possible last two digits for some multiple of 45 includes any 2-digit number that is a multiple of 5 and that appears in the multiples list above: {00,05,10,15,20,25,30,35,40,45,50,55,60,65,70,75,80,85,90,95}. That is **every multiple of 5** (all 2-digit endings divisible by 5) appears — because multiples of 45 cycle through all multiples of 5 modulo 100 before repeating. Therefore **all last two digits that are multiples of 5 (00, 05, 10, 15, …, 95)** are possible last two digits of a 4-digit number divisible by both 9 and 5. (But note not every such ending will make any particular 4-digit number divisible by 9 — however there exists some 4-digit number with that ending which is divisible by 45; so these endings are possible.)

So final answer: **All two-digit endings that are multiples of 5:**
00, 05, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95.

(If you instead wanted last **two** digits of a 4-digit number that simultaneously satisfy divisibility for **a particular** 4-digit number's other digits fixed, we'd test those. But asked generally, the set above is correct.)
