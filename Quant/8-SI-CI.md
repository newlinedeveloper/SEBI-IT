## 💸 **Simple Interest (SI) & Compound Interest (CI) — Complete Notes**

---

### 🔹 **1. Concept Overview**

Interest is the **extra amount paid for using someone else’s money**.

| Type                       | Meaning                                                                        |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Simple Interest (SI)**   | Interest calculated only on the *principal* for the entire time period.        |
| **Compound Interest (CI)** | Interest calculated on *principal + accumulated interest* of previous periods. |

---

### 🔹 **2. Key Formulas**

#### 🧮 **Simple Interest (SI)**

[
\text{SI} = \frac{P × R × T}{100}
]

Where:

* **P** = Principal (initial money)
* **R** = Rate of interest (% per annum)
* **T** = Time (in years)

**Total Amount (A)** = P + SI

---

#### 🧮 **Compound Interest (CI)**

[
A = P \times \left(1 + \frac{R}{100}\right)^T
]
[
CI = A - P
]

---

### 🔹 **3. Example — Basic**

> Find the **Compound Interest** on ₹10,000 for 2 years at 10% per annum.

[
A = 10000 × (1 + 10/100)^2 = 10000 × 1.21 = 12100
]
[
CI = 12100 − 10000 = ₹2100
]
✅ **Answer: ₹2100**

---

### 🔹 **4. Difference Between SI & CI**

| Term      | Simple Interest | Compound Interest  |
| --------- | --------------- | ------------------ |
| Formula   | (P×R×T)/100     | P[(1+R/100)^T – 1] |
| Growth    | Linear          | Exponential        |
| Principal | Constant        | Grows each year    |

---

### 🔹 **5. CI When Interest is Compounded Half-Yearly or Quarterly**

If **compounded half-yearly:**
[
R \to \frac{R}{2}, \quad T \to 2T
]
If **compounded quarterly:**
[
R \to \frac{R}{4}, \quad T \to 4T
]

---

### 🔹 **6. Formula for Difference Between CI & SI**

For **2 years**:
[
\text{Difference} = P \times \left(\frac{R}{100}\right)^2
]

For **3 years**:
[
\text{Difference} = P \times \left(\frac{R}{100}\right)^2 \times \left(\frac{R}{100} + 3\right)
]

---

### 🔹 **7. Effective Rate of Interest (for CI)**

If compounded **n times** a year:
[
\text{Effective Rate} = \left(1 + \frac{R}{n×100}\right)^n - 1
]

### ✅ **Solutions (Moderate-Level)**

1️⃣ 500 = (2500×R×4)/100 → R=5%
2️⃣ 7260 = P×(1.1)² → P = 6000
3️⃣ Diff = P×(R/100)² = 24 → 12000×R²/10000=24 → R=4%
4️⃣ 80 = (500×8×T)/100 → T=2 years
5️⃣ (1+R/100)⁵=1.25 → R≈4.56%
6️⃣ (1+R/100)¹⁰=3 → R≈11.61%
7️⃣ Half-yearly → R=6.25%, T=4 → A=8000(1.0625)⁴=10203 → CI=₹203
8️⃣ (1200×R×2)/100 = 1000×R/100 → 2×1200=1000 → Invalid → R=0 → Check: SI=24R=10R → R=0 → Mistyped. Correct: SI=24R/10 → skip.
Let’s correct: SI=1200×R×2/100, CI=1000×R/100 → 24R=10R→R=0→**No valid**, skip.
9️⃣ Difference for 3 years = P×(R/100)²×(R/100 + 3) → 5000×R²/10000×(R/100+3)=61 → Solve → R≈4%
10️⃣ (1+R/100)⁶=2 → R≈12.25%
