**Mixture & Alligation**

This topic appears in bank, SSC, CAT, and aptitude exams frequently, especially when mixing **milk & water**, **cost of articles**, or **acid concentrations**.

## 🧩 **Concept: Mixture & Alligation**

When two or more ingredients are mixed, the resulting **mean value** (average concentration, cost, or price) lies **between** the values of the individual components.

The **Alligation Rule** gives the **ratio** in which these ingredients must be mixed.

---

### 🔹 **Key Formula**

If we mix two items:

* First item value = ( V_1 )
* Second item value = ( V_2 )
* Mean (mixture) value = ( M )

Then,

[
\frac{Q_1}{Q_2} = \frac{V_2 - M}{M - V_1}
]

Where ( Q_1 : Q_2 ) is the **ratio** of quantities of the two ingredients.

---

### 🔹 **Types of Questions**

1. **Simple Mixtures:** Mixing two varieties (e.g., sugar at ₹30/kg and ₹50/kg to get ₹40/kg).
2. **Replacement Problems:** Removing a portion of a mixture and adding another liquid.
3. **Percentage Mixtures:** Acid-water, milk-water, or alcohol-water solutions.

---

### 🔹 **Example**

A 30% acid solution is mixed with a 50% acid solution to get 40%.
Find the ratio of the two solutions.

**Solution:**

[
\frac{Q_1}{Q_2} = \frac{50 - 40}{40 - 30} = \frac{10}{10} = 1:1
]

So, equal quantities of both solutions are needed.

| ------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Milk and water            | % of milk               |
| Sugar at different prices | ₹ per kg                |

→ (70−50):(50−40)=20:10 ⇒ **2:1**

---

### 2️⃣

Milk costs ₹40/l, water ₹0/l. Mixture costs ₹32/l. Find ratio of milk to water.
→ (40−32):(32−0)=8:32 ⇒ **1:4**

So, **1 part milk : 4 parts water**

---

### 3️⃣

Sugar solution 60% mixed with water (0%) to make 45%. Ratio?
→ (60−45):(45−0)=15:45 ⇒ **1:3**

---

### 4️⃣

Two oils costing ₹50/l and ₹80/l mixed to get ₹60/l. Ratio?
→ (80−60):(60−50)=20:10 ⇒ **2:1**

---

### 5️⃣

A mixture has milk & water in 5:1. If 6 litres of water are added, ratio becomes 5:2. Find quantity of milk.
Let milk = 5x, water = x.
Add 6L water → ratio = 5x : (x+6) = 5:2
Cross multiply → 2×5x = 5×(x+6) ⇒ 10x = 5x + 30 ⇒ x=6 ⇒ Milk = 5×6 = **30 L**

---

### 6️⃣

A vessel has 60L mixture of milk & water in 2:1. How much water to add to make ratio 1:1?
Milk = 40L, Water = 20L. Let x = water added.
40 : (20 + x) = 1 : 1 ⇒ 40 = 20 + x ⇒ **x = 20 L**

---

### 7️⃣

A mixture contains 30% water. If 4L water is added, new concentration becomes 40%. Find initial mixture quantity.
Let total = x, water = 0.3x.
After adding 4L water, water = 0.3x + 4; total = x + 4
New ratio: (0.3x + 4)/(x + 4) = 0.4
→ 0.3x + 4 = 0.4x + 1.6 ⇒ 4 − 1.6 = 0.1x ⇒ x = **24 L**

---

### 8️⃣

Two acids 20% and 60% mixed to make 30% solution. Ratio?
→ (60−30):(30−20)=30:10 ⇒ **3:1**

---

### 9️⃣

A 40L mixture has milk and water in 3:1. How much water to add so that ratio becomes 1:1?
Milk = 30L, Water = 10L. Let x = added water.
30 : (10+x) = 1 : 1 ⇒ 30 = 10 + x ⇒ **x = 20 L**

---

### 🔟

A 60L mixture has 25% alcohol. How much pure alcohol to add to make it 50%?
Let x = alcohol added.
Alcohol before = 0.25×60 = 15L.
After addition → (15 + x) / (60 + x) = 0.5
→ 15 + x = 30 + 0.5x ⇒ 0.5x = 15 ⇒ x = **30 L**
