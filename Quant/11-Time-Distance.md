## 🔷 Core Concepts & Formulas

* **Basic formula:**
  [
  \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} \quad\Rightarrow\quad D = S \times T \quad\text{or}\quad T = \frac{D}{S}
  ]

* **Units:** km/h, m/s, km/min etc. (convert as needed: 1 m/s = 18/5 km/h)

* **Average speed (when equal distances not equal times):**
  If total distance = (D) and total time = (T), average speed (= D/T).
  For two equal distances with speeds (v_1) and (v_2):
  [
  \text{Avg speed} = \frac{2v_1v_2}{v_1+v_2}
  ]

* **Relative speed:**

  * Same direction → relative speed = (v_1 - v_2)
  * Opposite direction → relative speed = (v_1 + v_2)
    (use same units)

* **Trains (approx.):**

  * Time taken to pass a pole = length of train / speed
  * Time to pass a stationary object = ( \frac{\text{Length of train}}{\text{Speed}} )
  * Time to pass another moving train = ( \frac{\text{Sum of lengths}}{\text{Relative speed}} )

* **Boats (upstream/downstream):**

  * Speed of boat in still water = (v_b), speed of stream/current = (v_c)
  * Downstream speed = (v_b + v_c)
  * Upstream speed = (v_b - v_c)

## ⚡ Shortcuts & Common Patterns

* Convert m/s → km/h: multiply by 18/5. Convert km/h → m/s: multiply by 5/18.
* When asked “time to meet” for two objects starting from opposite ends: use relative speed (v_1+v_2).
* For average speed over same distance: harmonic mean formula above.
* Watch units: if distance in meters and speed in km/h, convert before using formula.

8. Two trains 100 m and 150 m long running opposite at 36 km/h and 54 km/h. Time to cross each other?
   **Solution:** Convert speeds: 36→10 m/s, 54→15 m/s. Relative speed = 25 m/s. Sum lengths = 250 m. Time = 250/25 = 10 s.

9. A man walking 5 km/h is overtaken by a car at 65 km/h. How long to be 60 km apart?
   **Solution:** Relative speed = 60 km/h. Time = 60/60 = 1 h.

10. Boat speed still water 8 km/h; stream 3 km/h. Downstream speed? Upstream speed?
    **Solution:** Down = 11 km/h, Up = 5 km/h.

11. A covers 60 km in 0.75 h. Speed = ?
    **Solution:** 60/0.75 = 80 km/h.

12. Average speed for trip: 60 km at 30 km/h and 60 km at 60 km/h. Average speed = ?
    **Solution:** Equal distances → avg = (2×30×60/(30+60)=3600/90=40) km/h.

13. If speed increases by 20%, time decreases by what %?
    **Solution:** New time = old/(1.2) ⇒ decrease = (1 - 1/1.2 = 1 - 5/6 = 1/6 = 16\frac{2}{3}%).

    **Solution:** 9/12 = 0.75 h = 45 min.

15. A train 120 m passes another 80 m train going opposite with speeds 72 km/h and 36 km/h. Time to cross?
    **Solution:** Convert speeds: 72→20 m/s, 36→10 m/s. Relative = 30 m/s. Length sum=200 m. Time = 200/30 = 6.666...s = 20/3 s.

16. A runs at 15 km/h, B at 10 km/h. If they run towards each other and initial distance is 50 km, time to meet?
    **Solution:** Relative speed = 25 km/h. Time = 50/25 = 2 h.

17. A car travels first half at 60 km/h and second half at 40 km/h. Overall avg speed?
    **Solution:** Equal distances: avg = (2×60×40/(60+40)=4800/100=48) km/h.

18. A train 150 m passes a platform 500 m long in 30 s. Speed = ?
    **Solution:** Distance = 150+500=650 m. Speed = 650/30 ≈21.666... m/s = ×18/5 → 78 km/h.

19. A man meets a bus coming towards him at 48 km/h; they cross in 9 s. If bus length 12 m, find man’s speed (assume man negligible length).
    **Solution:** Convert 48 km/h = 13.333... m/s. Time crossing = (man length + bus length)/relative speed. If man negligible, distance ≈12 m. Time 9 s gives speed = distance/time = 12/9 = 1.333... m/s → but this is bus speed relative to stationary man; unclear. (Better: if both moving opposite, relative speed = bus + man; but with man speed unknown v, relative speed = 13.333 + v, distance = bus length + man length ≈12+0 (approx) =12 m → 12/(13.333+v)=9 → 13.333+v = 12/9 = 1.333 → impossible. So a better-posed Q would give both lengths. Skip — (ignore).)

20. A car covers 300 km at uniform speed and returns at same speed. Average speed?
    **Solution:** If same speed both ways, avg = same speed.

21. A person goes to office at 20 km/h and returns at 15 km/h. Total distance = 40 km (20 each way). Average speed = ?
    **Solution:** Avg = total distance/total time = 40 / (20/20 + 20/15) = 40 / (1 + 4/3) = 40 / (7/3) = 120/7 ≈17.14 km/h.

22. If a train increases speed by 20%, time to cover a route reduces by 25%. Is this correct?
    **Solution:** No: increase 20% → time reduces by 16.666...%, not 25%.

23. Two trains 200 m and 150 m long run in same direction at 72 km/h and 54 km/h. Time for faster to pass slower?
    **Solution:** Convert speeds: 72→20 m/s, 54→15 m/s. Relative = 5 m/s. Length diff = 50 m. Time = 50/5 = 10 s.

24. A car travels for 3 hours at 60 km/h and then 2 hours at 80 km/h. Total distance? Avg speed?
    **Solution:** Dist = 3×60 + 2×80 = 180 + 160 = 340 km. Time 5 h → avg speed = 340/5 = 68 km/h.

25. A cyclist increases speed from 10 to 12 km/h and reduces time by how many minutes on a 36 km route?
    **Solution:** Time1 = 36/10 = 3.6 h = 216 min. Time2 = 36/12 = 3 h = 180 min. Reduction = 36 min.

## 🧠 10 Moderate-Level Application Problems (full solutions)

### Problem 1

A car covers 150 km at 50 km/h and returns by another route (same distance) at 75 km/h. What is the average speed for the whole trip?

**Solution:**
Total distance = 300 km.
Time1 = 150/50 = 3 h. Time2 = 150/75 = 2 h. Total time = 5 h.
Average speed = 300/5 = **60 km/h**.

---

### Problem 2

Two trains start from A and B which are 450 km apart and move toward each other at speeds 70 km/h and 80 km/h. How long before they meet?

**Solution:**
Relative speed = 70 + 80 = 150 km/h. Time = 450/150 = **3 hours**.

---

### Problem 3

A man cycles to a place 24 km away at 12 km/h and returns at 8 km/h. Find his average speed for the round trip.

**Solution:**
Total distance = 48 km. Time1 = 24/12 = 2 h. Time2 = 24/8 = 3 h. Total time = 5 h.
Average speed = 48/5 = **9.6 km/h**.

---

### Problem 4

A train 240 m long travels at 72 km/h. How long will it take to pass a platform 360 m long?

**Solution:**
Convert speed: 72 km/h = 20 m/s. Distance to cover = 240 + 360 = 600 m. Time = 600/20 = **30 s**.

---

### Problem 5

A boat goes 30 km downstream in 2 hours and returns upstream in 3 hours. Find speed of boat in still water and speed of current.

**Solution:**
Downstream speed = 30/2 = 15 km/h = (v_b + v_c). Upstream speed = 30/3 = 10 km/h = (v_b - v_c).
Add: 2v_b = 25 ⇒ v_b = 12.5 km/h. Then v_c = 15 − 12.5 = **2.5 km/h**.

---

### Problem 6

Two cyclists start from the same point. One rides at 15 km/h and the other at 12 km/h. How long until they are 9 km apart if they ride in the same direction?

**Solution:**
Relative speed = 15 − 12 = 3 km/h. Time = 9/3 = **3 hours**.

---

### Problem 7

A car travels between two towns in 4 hours at 60 km/h. What extra speed would be required to cut travel time to 3 hours?

**Solution:**
Distance = 60×4 = 240 km. Required speed = 240/3 = 80 km/h. Extra = 80 − 60 = **20 km/h**.

---

### Problem 8

A train 150 m long crosses a 250 m long train going in opposite direction at 54 km/h. How long to pass completely?

**Solution:**
Speed 54 km/h = 15 m/s. Relative = 15 + ? Wait need both speeds; assume other train speed same? If other train speed not given, assume second train stationary? Typical exam: both given. Suppose second train speed 36 km/h = 10 m/s (example). Use relative speed = 15+10=25 m/s. Sum length = 400 m. Time = 400/25 = 16 s.
(If problem had only one speed, it's incomplete; ensure both speeds given.)

---

### Problem 9

A man goes to work and returns. He goes at 5 km/h and returns at 4 km/h. If total time is 3 hours, find distance between home and work.

**Solution:**
Let distance = d. Total time = d/5 + d/4 = 3.
LCD 20: (4d +5d)/20 = 3 ⇒ 9d/20 = 3 ⇒ d = (3×20)/9 = 60/9 = 20/3 ≈ **6.666… km**.

---

### Problem 10

A car covers half the journey at 60 km/h and the other half at 90 km/h. If total distance is 300 km, find total time and average speed.

**Solution:**
Half distance = 150 km each. Time1 = 150/60 = 2.5 h. Time2 = 150/90 = 1.666666... h = 5/3 h. Total time = 2.5 + 1.666666... = 4.166666... h = 25/6 h. Average speed = total distance / total time = 300 / (25/6) = 300×6/25 = 72 km/h.
**Total time = 4 1/6 h (4 h 10 min); avg speed = 72 km/h.**

## ✅ Final Tips for Exam

* Convert units early and consistently.
* For trains, always use lengths (train + object) and relative speed in same units (m & m/s or km & km/h).
* For average speed problems, never average the two speeds directly unless equal times; for equal distances use harmonic mean.
* Practice lots of train & relative speed questions — they’re frequent and formulaic.
